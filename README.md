# November Talkies (NT)

NT, or November Talkies is a Twitter-modeled short _Movie Review_ application. It allows users to follow their favaourite movie reviewer, friends, just like Twitter. Each reviews are restricted to 200 characters, thereby providing a quick-short picture of the movie.

Inspired from gothinkster's famous realworld repository, this project services as a _playground_ for experimenting with different tech stacks. This provides a good oppurtunity to learn and experiment with different frameworks while working on a real world sample project.
