# November Talkies (NT)

NT, or November Talkies is a Twitter-modeled short _Movie Review_ application. It allows users to follow their favaourite movie reviewer, friends, just like Twitter. Each reviews are restricted to 200 characters, thereby providing a quick-short picture of the movie.

Inspired from gothinkster's famous realworld repository, this project services as a _playground_ for experimenting with different tech stacks. This provides a good oppurtunity to learn and experiment with different frameworks while working on a real world sample project.

The same project is implemented using different frameworks. All the backend projects follow the same [API definition](https://github.com/anuviswan/nt/tree/master/server/nt.api.definition).

## Current Implementations

### Backend

 - [.Net Web API MVC](https://github.com/anuviswan/nt/tree/master/server/nt.webapi)

  - [.Net Web Api MVC Microservices](https://github.com/anuviswan/nt/tree/master/server/nt.microservice) 

  The backend projects are tracked using the [Backend Dashboard](https://github.com/users/anuviswan/projects/3). 

### Frontend

  - [ReactJs ContextApi](https://github.com/anuviswan/nt/tree/master/nt.webclient/reactjs) 
  -  [Vue 2](https://github.com/anuviswan/nt/tree/master/client/nt.webclient/vuejs)
  -  [Vue 3  Composition Api](https://github.com/anuviswan/nt/tree/master/client/nt.webclient/vue3)         
  - [Vue 3 + Typescript](https://github.com/anuviswan/nt/tree/master/client/nt.webclient/vue3withtypescript/nt)
  - [WPF + C#](https://github.com/anuviswan/nt/tree/master/nt.desktop/wpf/nt.wpfclient) 

The frontend projects are tracked using the [Project Dashboard](https://github.com/users/anuviswan/projects/2)
